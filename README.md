### Data structures in PHP

#### Why this project?
You are a PHP Web developer and sometimes you get to an interview and you are sometimes
asked about Data Structures. Now these are useful things to now but lets face facts, 
you are expected to learn a slew of frameworks and libraries and most times you never get
to work with the data structures directly. Example, you may be told to implement certain data structures like Linked List, Stack or Queue etc. 

In as much as these knowledge is vital and good to know, you everyday web programming in PHP tends to be looping over and array or using built in PHP functions. 
So I decided to build this up so as to make it a quick refresher for subsequent coding interviews.
